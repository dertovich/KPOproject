** DESCRIPTION:
**		The memccpy() function copies no more than n bytes from memory area src 
**	to memory area dst, stopping when the character c is found. If the memory 
**	areas overlap, the results are undefined. 
**		It returns a pointer to the next character in dst after c, or NULL if 
**	c was not found in the first n characters of src.
